                A little bit about me:
            </h3>
            <p>
                <em>Hello</em>, my name is <strong>Ashlee Earle</strong> Currently I am a student at Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design course.<br>
                Recently, I also graduated this past August, from Algonquin's Business-Marketing program as well, however I don't walk accorss the stage until NEXT June! üòÆüéì<br>
                I also graduated from 3D Computer Animation in 2018 from the Vancouver Animation School, where I was taught by some incredible professionals who worked<br> on productions such as Star Wars, Hotel Transylvania, Mulan, Scooby-Doo and more!<br>
            </p>
            <p>  
                I like to create art both tradtionally and digitally through a variety of mediums, as well as like to try various artistic hobbies like photography or jewelry making. <br>
                I think that one day, if I get the space for it, I would also like to get into sculpture or pottery, as well as sewing to create my own clothing.
            </p>
