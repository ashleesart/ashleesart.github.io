          <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
          <p><em>Hello</em>, my name is <strong>Ashlee Earle</strong>. Currently I am a student at Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design course.<br>
          Recently, I also graduated this past August, from Algonquin's Business-Marketing program as well, however I don't walk across the stage until NEXT June! üòÆüéì<br>
          I also graduated from 3D Computer Animation in 2018 from the Vancouver Animation School, where I was taught by some incredible professionals who worked<br>
          on productions such as Star Wars, Hotel Transylvania, Mulan, Scooby-Doo and more!<br></p>
          <p>I like to create art both traditionally and digitally through a variety of mediums, as well as like to try various artistic hobbies like photography or jewelry making.<br>
          I think that one day, if I get the space for it, I would also like to get into sculpture or pottery, as well as sewing to create my own clothing.</p>
